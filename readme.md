## My process
I mostly Used Flex box to center the diffrent parts like the qrCode in the middle the link below it.

### Continued development
I tried it to be responsive more than just mobile phone and desktop screens. 
Which to my disbelief made me a bunch of media querries but was at last able to cut it down to just one.
